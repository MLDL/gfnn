# Revisiting Graph Neural Networks: All We Have is Low-Pass Filters
In this work, we study graph neural networks for vertex classification. This work is conducted at [RIKEN AIP](https://aip.riken.jp/). [Our preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09550) is uploaded on arXiv.

## Requirements

Create an Python 3.6 environment and install these packages:

```python
numpy
scipy
networkx==1.11
scikit-learn
pytorch
torchvision
```

## Acknowledgement
This reposipory is built upon SGC, FastGCN, and GCN. I would like to say thanks
to the authors of these repository for making their code available.
